  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised change detection
	in high spatial resolution optical remote sensing images based on
	Hopfield neural network (HNN). An optimization relaxation approach
	based on the analysis of a modified Hopfield neural network is proposed
	for solving the change detection problem. The modified Hopfield neural
	network is designed to characterize a texture in terms of spatial-contextual
	information included in the neighborhood of each pixel within each
	color plane and interaction between different color planes. The network
	topology is built on the difference image so that each pixel in the
	RGB color planes is represented as a node in the network which is
	connected to its neighborhood units both in its own plane and other
	two planes. Each node is represented by its state which characterizes
	the pixel changed or unchanged, and an energy function is derived
	to represent the overall status of the whole network. Change detection
	maps are obtained by iteratively updating the output status of the
	neurons until the network converges. The main contribution of this
	paper lies in the construction of a novel continuous Hopfield-type
	neural network on the RGB image for solving the unsupervised image
	change detection problem. Experiments results obtained on two sets
	of remote sensing imagery confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
	approach.},

	The proposed AL technique is developed in the framework of the Bayes'
	rule for compound classification. At each iteration, it selects the
	pair of spatially aligned unlabeled pixels in the two images that
	are classified with the maximum uncertainty. These pixels are then
	labeled by an external supervisor and included in the training set.
	The uncertainty of a pair of pixels is assessed by the joint entropy
	defined by considering two possible different simplifying assumptions:
	1) class-conditional independence and 2) temporal independence between
	multitemporal images. Accordingly, different algorithms are introduced.
	The proposed joint-entropy-based AL algorithms for compound classification
	are compared with each other and with a marginal-entropy-based AL
	technique (in which the entropy is computed separately on single-date
	images) applied to the postclassification comparison method. The

	of the ensemble model is exploited and the process of model training
	and model structure selection is parallelized across multiple GPU

  abstract = {Due to the simplicity of their implementations, least square support
	vector machine (LS-SVM) and proximal support vector machine (PSVM)
	have been widely used in binary classification applications. The
	conventional LS-SVM and PSVM cannot be used in regression and multiclass
	classification applications directly, although variants of LS-SVM
	and PSVM have been proposed to handle such cases. This paper shows
	that both LS-SVM and PSVM can be simplified further and a unified
	learning framework of LS-SVM, PSVM, and other regularization algorithms
	referred to extreme learning machine (ELM) can be built. ELM works
	for the #x201C;generalized #x201D; single-hidden-layer feedforward
	networks (SLFNs), but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping)
	in ELM need not be tuned. Such SLFNs include but are not limited
	to SVM, polynomial network, and the conventional feedforward neural
	networks. This paper shows the following: 1) ELM provides a unified
	learning platform with a widespread type of feature mappings and
	can be applied in regression and multiclass classification applications
	directly; 2) from the optimization method point of view, ELM has
	milder optimization constraints compared to LS-SVM and PSVM; 3) in
	theory, compared to ELM, LS-SVM and PSVM achieve suboptimal solutions
	and require higher computational complexity; and 4) in theory, ELM
	can approximate any target continuous function and classify any disjoint
	regions. As verified by the simulation results, ELM tends to have
	better scalability and achieve similar (for regression and binary
	class cases) or much better (for multiclass cases) generalization
	performance at much faster learning speed (up to thousands times)
	than traditional SVM and LS-SVM.},

  abstract = {It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks
	is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck
	in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may
	be: (1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively
	used to train neural networks, and (2) all the parameters of the
	networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms.
	Unlike these conventional implementations, this paper proposes a
	new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for
	single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly
	chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights
	of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide good generalization
	performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results
	based on a few artificial and real benchmark function approximation
	and classification problems including very large complex applications
	show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance
	in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional
	popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.11For

	An independent set of accuracy assessment points was selected using
	a disproportionate stratified sampling strategy to support the development

  abstract = { Characterising land cover and detecting land-cover changes using
	spatial methods is an area of research that has been attracting increasing
	attention recently. We compare performances of selected pattern recognition
	methods for characterising different land covers using unclassified
	Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for a lowland site in north-eastern
	Costa Rica. Two spatial statistics (fractal dimension, using the
	isarithm and triangular prism surface area (TPSA) methods, and Moran's
	I index of spatial autocorrelation) and selected landscape indices
	(Shannon's diversity index, contagion, and fractal dimension from
	perimeter/area) were investigated. Mean values of each metric for
	each cover type were calculated for subset areas representing forest,
	agriculture, pasture, and scrub, for all seven Landsat-TM bands and
	the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Fractal dimension
	( D TPSA ) and Moran's I were found to be useful for characterising
	spatial complexity of Landsat-TM data, whereas the standard landscape
	indices were not. Values of D TPSA decreased along a gradient of
	increasing human disturbance: old-growth forest-scrub-pasture-agriculture.
	These results can be further applied locally using moving windows
	for change detection in global environmental change studies. Moreover,
	in this information era characterized by increasingly abundant imagery,
	these spatial statistics could serve as metadata for content-based
	data mining of imagery. },

  abstract = {Although classification in centralized environments has been widely

	for classification in P2P networks due to the popularity of P2P computing
	environments. The main target of classification in P2P networks is
	how to efficiently decrease prediction error with small network overhead.
	In this paper, we propose an OS-ELM based ensemble classification
	framework for distributed classification in a hierarchical P2P network.
	In the framework, we apply the incremental learning principle of
	OS-ELM to the hierarchical P2P network to generate an ensemble classifier.
	There are two kinds of implementation methods of the ensemble classifier
	in the P2P network, one-by-one ensemble classification and parallel
	ensemble classification. Furthermore, we propose a data space coverage
	based peer selection approach to reduce high the communication cost
	and large delay. We also design a two-layer index structure to efficiently
	support peer selection. A peer creates a local Quad-tree to index
	its local data and a super-peer creates a global Quad-tree to summarize
	its local indexes. Extensive experimental studies verify the efficiency
	and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},
